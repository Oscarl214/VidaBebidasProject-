    "reviews": "We had an amazing experience with Michael. Our guests couldn't stop complimenting the drinks! The Watermelon Paloma, Blackberry Coconut Mojito, Pineapple Fizz, and Green Tea shots were all hits. The fruits and garnishes were incredibly fresh, adding a special touch to each cocktail. Michael was very professional and provided us with a detailed list of items to purchase. Next time, we'll definitely stock up more on ingredients for the Green Tea shotsâ€”they were a huge favorite among our friends. The Watermelon Paloma was my personal favorite, and he's able to make them virgin. Will definitely be booking him again for my next event. Highly recommend!",
